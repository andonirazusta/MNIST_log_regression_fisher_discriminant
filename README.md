# MNIST_log_regression_fisher_discriminant
 The purpose of this project is to understand how machine and deep learning algorithms work. For that, the MNIST handwritten digit dataset will be used and two algorithms will be implemented: A Fisher linear discriminant and a Logistic regression with a neural network mindset.
